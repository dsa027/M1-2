## __Module 1 Lesson 2__

1. "What did you learn in this checkpoint? Did you encounter 
any issues getting your browser, text editor, or terminal installed? 
If so, what steps did you take to solve them? Send your mentor a message 
and let them know."

1A. I had set up my environment last week using Bloc documents as a guide. 
I installed Atom, which I'd never heard of. I played around with Atom extensively
using problems from RubyMonk. 

I installed PowerShell last week as a terminal, but am now using Git Bash. 
I had Git, both GUI and command line already installed. I played around with
using Git using my assignments to create new repositories and committing locally
and pushing to GitHub.

I also have Ruby and Rails installed and went through a large number of
problems and lessons to learn and play with the two.

The only issues I had were installing Rails. I couldn't install the latest stable 
version. I tried and a simple "Rails" command wouldn't work. So I installed the 
previous version (5.1.4). It's possible that the latest version would work
and that I was doing something wrong, but I can't find it and 5.1.4 works great.
Note: Rails isn't on the assignment, I just thought I'd relate the info.
